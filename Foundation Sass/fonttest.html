                So things are quiet, y'know? Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now. Well, we keep hearing a name. Heisenberg. Lately pretty much every dimebagger we come across. Yeah, I know. Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend. Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding. Come here... closer... Asshole.
                I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was. I think your car was there because you were there. Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and I think you know something about that, too. 
                Sky, the, um... I know it's none of my business, but uh... keeping him away from the kids? Whoa, whoa, no heavy lifting. I got it. Jesus, what you got in there - cinder blocks? If I have to guess, I'd say that's Spanish for asshole. You? No. Only shooting that you do is into a Kleenex. 
                Our next three moves are sitting here and waiting. This here's the job buddy. Ain't all super models and speed boats, you know. Not a lot happening stateside. Hearing rumblings about some big play down south. Lots of bodies apparently. Y'know even by Cartel standards. We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.
